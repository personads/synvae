  This method generates `branch_factor` branches for each sequence in the beam,

  to `generate_step_fn`). The resulting beam is returned.

  Args:
    beam_entries: A list of BeamEntry tuples, the current beam.
    generate_step_fn: A function that takes three parameters: a list of
        sequences, a list of states, and a list of scores, all of the same size.
        The function should generate a single step for each of the sequences and
        return the extended sequences, updated states, and updated (total)
        scores, as three lists. The function may modify the sequences, states,
        and scores in place, but should also return the modified values.

  Initially, the beam is filled with `beam_size` copies of the initial sequence.

  Each iteration, the beam is pruned to contain only the `beam_size` event
  sequences with highest score. Then `branch_factor` new event sequences are
  generated for each sequence in the beam. These new sequences are formed by
  extending each sequence in the beam by `steps_per_iteration` steps. So between
  a branching and a pruning phase, there will be `beam_size` * `branch_factor`
  active event sequences.

  After the final iteration, the single sequence in the beam with highest
  likelihood will be returned.

  The `generate_step_fn` function operates on lists of sequences + states +
  scores rather than single sequences. This is to allow for the possibility of
  batching.

  Args:
    initial_sequence: The initial sequence, a Python list-like object.
    initial_state: The state corresponding to the initial sequence, with any
        auxiliary information needed for extending the sequence.
    generate_step_fn: A function that takes three parameters: a list of
        sequences, a list of states, and a list of scores, all of the same size.
        The function should generate a single step for each of the sequences and
        return the extended sequences, updated states, and updated (total)
