"""Classes for converting between event sequences and models inputs/outputs.

OneHotEncoding is an abstract class for specifying a one-hot encoding, i.e.
how to convert back and forth between an arbitrary event space and integer
indices between 0 and the number of classes.

EventSequenceEncoderDecoder is an abstract class for translating event
_sequences_, i.e. how to convert event sequences to input vectors and output
labels to be fed into a model, and how to convert from output labels back to
events.

Use EventSequenceEncoderDecoder.encode to convert an event sequence to a
tf.train.SequenceExample of inputs and labels. These SequenceExamples are fed
into the model during training and evaluation.

During generation, use EventSequenceEncoderDecoder.get_inputs_batch to convert a
list of event sequences into an inputs batch which can be fed into the model to
predict what the next event should be for each sequence. Then use
EventSequenceEncoderDecoder.extend_event_sequences to extend each of those event
sequences with an event sampled from the softmax output by the model.

OneHotEventSequenceEncoderDecoder is an EventSequenceEncoderDecoder that uses a
OneHotEncoding of individual events. The input vectors are one-hot encodings of
the most recent event. The output labels are one-hot encodings of the next
event.

LookbackEventSequenceEncoderDecoder is an EventSequenceEncoderDecoder that also
uses a OneHotEncoding of individual events. However, its input and output
encodings also consider whether the event sequence is repeating, and the input
encoding includes binary counters for timekeeping.

  can be different.

  Model inputs are determined by both control and target sequences, and are
  formed by concatenating the encoded control and target input vectors. Model
  outputs are determined by the target sequence only.

  This implementation assumes that the control event at position `i` is known
  when the target event at position `i` is to be generated.
