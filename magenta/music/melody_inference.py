  This is a work in progress and should not necessarily be expected to return

  1) Melody onsets always coincide with actual note onsets from the polyphonic

  2) When multiple notes are active, the melody note tends to be the note with
     the highest pitch.

  Args:
    sequence: The NoteSequence for which to infer melody. This NoteSequence will
        be modified in place, with inferred melody notes added as a new
        instrument.
    melody_interval_scale: The scale parameter for the prior distribution over
        melody intervals.
    rest_prob: The probability of rest after a melody note.
    instantaneous_non_max_pitch_prob: The instantaneous probability that the
        melody note will not have the maximum active pitch.

        least one note will be active during a melody rest.
