"""Classes for converting between chord progressions and models inputs/outputs.

MajorMinorChordOneHotEncoding is an encoding.OneHotEncoding that specifies a
one-hot encoding for ChordProgression events, i.e. chord symbol strings. This
encoding has 25 classes, all 12 major and minor triads plus "no chord".

TriadChordOneHotEncoding is another encoding.OneHotEncoding that specifies a
one-hot encoding for ChordProgression events, i.e. chord symbol strings. This
encoding has 49 classes, all 12 major/minor/augmented/diminished triads plus
"no chord".
