"""Utility functions for working with chord symbols.

The functions in this file treat a chord symbol string as having four
components:

  Root: The root pitch class of the chord, e.g. 'C#'.
  Kind: The type of chord, e.g. major, half-diminished, 13th. In the chord
      symbol figure string the chord kind is abbreviated, e.g. 'm' or '-' means
      minor, 'dim' or 'o' means diminished, '7' means dominant 7th.
  Scale degree modifications: Zero or more modifications to the scale degrees
      present in the chord. There are three different modification types:
      addition (add a new scale degree), subtraction (remove a scale degree),
      and alteration (modify a scale degree). For example, '#9' means to add a
      raised 9th, or to alter the 9th to be raised if a 9th was already present
      in the chord. Other possible modification strings include 'no3' (remove
      the 3rd scale degree), 'add2' (add the 2nd scale degree), 'b5' (flatten
      the 5th scale degree), etc.
  Bass: The bass pitch class of the chord. If missing, the bass pitch class is
      assumed to be the same as the root pitch class.

Before doing any other operations, the functions in this file attempt to
split the chord symbol figure string into these four components; if that
attempt fails a ChordSymbolError is raised.

After that, some operations leave some of the components unexamined, e.g.
transposition only modifies the root and bass, leaving the chord kind and scale
degree modifications unchanged.
